# 🚀 Supply Chain AI

## 📌 Project Overview
Supply Chain AI is a machine learning-driven project aimed at optimizing various aspects of supply chain management. This project includes demand forecasting, fraud detection, feature importance analysis, and error analysis to enhance decision-making.

## 🏗️ Features
- 📊 **Demand Forecasting**: Predict future demand using advanced ML models.
- 🔍 **Fraud Detection**: Identify fraudulent activities in the supply chain.
- 📌 **Feature Importance Analysis**: Determine which factors contribute most to predictions.
- 🛠️ **Error Analysis**: Assess model performance and reduce inaccuracies.
